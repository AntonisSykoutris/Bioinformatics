In this project I want to calculate the exponential growth rate in the European population of the coronavirus.

For this reason, I have downloaded data from gisaid (a coronavirus database)
and I have processed them in the **ms_obs_final.out** file.
Each row is a coronavirus genome and each column is a polymorphic site in
its genome.

To do the process of finding the rate of exponential growth, I use the
abc process, so I have generated 10,000 datasets in the **ms_sim_final.out** file.

With exponential growth parameter values given in the pars_final.txt file.
## Programming Languages

This project is using the following programming language

- R
